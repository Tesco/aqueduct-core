# Aqueduct

Delivers data to specific network locations in an efficient, secure and near real-time manner.

Note this is currently a work in progress product, and we wouldn't recommend using it in production yet. We intend to open source other related components and documentation in the near future.

## Objectives

1. Reduce network traffic usage by delivering data to location groups only once in most cases
2. Optimise the time taken to deliver data to a location
3. Throttle traffic not to impact the network
4. Only data required by the location is routed to it
